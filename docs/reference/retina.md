#### Retina displays

Retina is a marketing term coined by Apple that refers to devices and monitors that have a resolution and pixel density so high — roughly 300 or more pixels per inch – that a person is unable to discern the individual pixels at a normal viewing distance.

In order to generate beautiful charts for these Retina displays, Image-Charts supports a retina mode that can be activated through the `icretina=1` parameter. If the chart URL contains `icretina=1` parameter, the generated chart output will have its `width` and `height` size doubled.

#### Syntax

```
icretina=<retina_activation>
```

- **`<retina_activation>`** set to `1` to activate retina mode and double image size.

#### Example

Here is a graph of 700 pixels x 200 pixels without retina

```
icretina=0
```

Here is a graph of 700 pixels x 200 pixels with retina, image output size as doubled and no pixel will be seen on retina displays.

```
icretina=1
```


### Usage with `srcset`

The ideal solution is to send the high-resolution image chart version to devices that can use them, while maintaining a standard resolution for others, thus reducing bandwidth usage. The `srcset` HTML attribute with the x designator does just that and here is the basic idea:

```
<img src="image-charts-url.jpg" srcset="image-charts-url.jpg 1x, image-charts-url-with-icretina.jpg 2x" alt="My awesome chart">
```

- `image-charts-url.jpg` will be loaded on usual, standard-resolution device
- `image-charts-url-with-icretina.jpg` will be loaded on high-resolution device (e.g. Retina devices)

Considering that Image-Charts does not requires us to store our own image for our own good (it leverages word-wide CDNs), let's change this example to a more production-ready one:
